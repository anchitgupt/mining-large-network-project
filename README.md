# Mining Large Network - Academic Project
---

Migration network is one of the networks which were less studied in the area of Graph Machine Learning. Specially in India as most diversed country in world shows large migration and recorded each decade. So, in this we represent the migration happening between different states and union territories of India as a network and then apply different techniques to identify some pattern in the migration. We apply weighted link prediction methodology to get the projected counts of migrants for different areas of the country. Next we obtain the node embeddings of the migration network using Graph Convolution Network (GCN) by incorporating node features like in-migrants count, out-migrants count, population, etc. of the state/UT which are represented as nodes. Then we showed that count of migrants to a place is related to the literacy rate, GDP of the place. This kind of analysis can be of great use for the Government agencies involved in planning the development of cities for the growing population.
